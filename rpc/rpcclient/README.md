# rpcclient package

See godoc (`godoc ./ | less`)

TODO (Contributions welcome):

  * splitting rpc package was mostly automated, remove repeated code
  * could move this to opt/rpcclient, or anywhere better
  * may break all pools, dont merge this branch in to master
  * sync pool with this branch
