# Quick: Connect Metamask or Web3 Wallet

Use metamask "Add Network" with chainId `61717561` with your RPC url of choice.

If you don't have an RPC server of your own, you can use a public RPC server such as: `https://c.onical.org`

Some wallets allow you to customize the explorer URL, if that is the case use `https://aquachain.github.io/explorer/#/`

Note: Metamask users should use AQUAC as the 'symbol' for Aquachain. This will fix an issue with fetching fiat prices in the background it seems.
