[Aquachain](Basics) is powered by fuel, called Aqua. It is created by inserting a new block onto the blockchain in a process known as "mining". The reward for mining a block is 1 Aqua. The difficulty is adjusted every block in order to average a four minute interval between blocks. Nothing prevents anybody in the world with enough CPU power from mining a block, receiving the reward (1.0000 + all tx fees). Reward switches to "transaction fees only" after 42 million coins. Since around 360 coins are mined per day, this is expected to happen in around 300 years. The current supply can easily be viewed by visiting https://aquacha.in/supply

Besides [mining](https://aquacha.in/status/miners), here are some ways to acquire Aqua:

  * [Bisq](https://bisq.network) decentralized Bitcoin exchange
  * Over the counter (OTC) trading in the [discord](https://discord.gg/udXYDyB) or [telegram](@AquaCrypto) chats
  * List your product/service at the [Vendors](Vendors) wiki page

In the future:
  * Centralized Exchanges
  * Atomic swaps with other coins that have the ability
  * POSCROW contract if somebody deploys it(see [Poscrow](Poscrow))
