Storing things on the blockchain are forever. Think twice before uploading.

## IPFS

"InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system."

With IPFS you are able to upload a file, and retrieve it using the file's hash.

You can store a file's hash on the blockchain using the _Input_ or _Data_ field in a transaction.

It is on the roadmap to add file upload/download using the aquachain command.
